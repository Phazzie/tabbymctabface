# 🥚 The TabbyMcTabface Easter Egg Hunter's Guide

> _"The best easter eggs are the ones you don't know you're looking for."_

## 🎯 The Challenge

TabbyMcTabface has **160 hidden easter eggs** scattered throughout its passive-aggressive soul. They're triggered by specific patterns in your browsing behavior, and we're not telling you what they are.

**Why?** Because discovery is half the fun.

## 🔍 What We WILL Tell You

### The Only Hint

**The Answer to Everything** 🌌
- **Clue**: Douglas Adams fans will know
- **Hint**: It's a very specific number of tabs
- **Why**: Because the answer to life, the universe, and everything is... well, you know.

Try it. See what happens.

That's the only freebie you get.

## 🤔 Categories That May Or May Not Exist

We're not saying these categories exist. We're just saying... if they did exist... they might include:

- ⏰ **Time-based triggers** - When you browse matters
- 🔢 **Tab count milestones** - Some numbers are more special than others
- 🌐 **Domain patterns** - Where you browse reveals much
- 📊 **Statistical achievements** - Patterns in your chaos
- 🎨 **Organizational feats** - Or lack thereof
- 🧠 **Philosophical moments** - When your tabs get deep
- 🎮 **Pop culture references** - For the cultured browser user
- 🌙 **Nocturnal activities** - Night owl behavior
- ✨ **The unexpected** - The ones you can't plan for

But again, we're not confirming or denying anything.

## 💡 Tips for Discovery

### Do This:
1. **Browse Naturally**: The best discoveries happen when you're not hunting
2. **Pay Attention**: Notice when a quip feels different or extra clever
3. **Experiment**: Try weird numbers. Browse at odd hours. Go extreme.
4. **Vary Your Patterns**: Sometimes high tab counts, sometimes minimal
5. **Use Different Sites**: Some domains may... trigger things
6. **Create Groups**: Or don't. Both strategies have merit.
7. **Stay Curious**: 105 is a lot of eggs. You won't find them all quickly.

### Don't Do This:
1. ❌ Expect a tracker or achievement list (we're not that organized)
2. ❌ Try to "game" the system systematically
3. ❌ Get frustrated if you're not finding them
4. ❌ Look for patterns in the source code (that's cheating!)
5. ❌ Demand hints (we already gave you one)

## 🎲 The Philosophy

Easter eggs should be:
- **Surprising**: You stumble upon them naturally
- **Delightful**: They make you smile when discovered
- **Shareable**: You want to tell others (but maybe not spoil everything)
- **Mysterious**: Not knowing is part of the fun
- **Rewarding**: Finding one feels like an achievement

We built 160 of them so that even power users will still be discovering new ones months later.

---

## 📸 When You Find One

**How You'll Know**:
- The quip will feel... different
- More specific than usual
- Extra clever
- Oddly relevant to your exact situation
- You'll probably think "wait, did they...?"

**What To Do**:
1. Screenshot it! (Before the notification disappears)
2. Share it on social media if you want
3. Feel smug about your discovery
4. Wonder what other eggs are hiding
5. Keep browsing

---

## 🏆 The Non-Achievement System

**We deliberately didn't include**:
- Achievement tracker
- Progress bars
- "You found 23/160!" counters
- Hint systems
- Unlock notifications

**Why?** Because once you start tracking, it stops being fun and starts being a checklist. We want you to be genuinely surprised, not grinding achievements.

---

## 🤫 Community Guidelines

### Sharing Discoveries:
✅ **Do**: Share your amazing finds on social media  
✅ **Do**: Be vague about the trigger ("I had a lot of tabs and...")  
✅ **Do**: Celebrate your discoveries with others  
✅ **Do**: Share screenshots of great quips  

❌ **Don't**: Post complete trigger lists  
❌ **Don't**: Spoil all 160 easter eggs  
❌ **Don't**: Create "how to unlock all easter eggs" guides  
❌ **Don't**: Ruin the mystery for everyone else  

### The Golden Rule:
Share the joy of discovery, not the roadmap to it.

## 🎯 Advanced Hunter Tactics

For the truly dedicated easter egg hunters, consider:

**The Naturalist Approach**:

- Pay attention to *when* you get easter eggs
- Note what you were doing
- Look for correlations

## 🎪 The Meta Game

Some questions to ponder:

- Is there an easter egg for having no easter eggs?
- Do multiple easter eggs trigger from the same action?
- Are some rarer than others?
- Do easter eggs have easter eggs?
- Is this guide itself an easter egg?

We're not answering these. Figure it out yourself.
