### 3. Hidden Easter Eggs & Achievement System ü•öüèÜ

**What they are**: Secret context-aware humor that unlocks based on your browsing behavior

**The Mystery**: TabbyMcTabface watches your tab usage and unlocks special achievements when you trigger certain... situations. We're not telling you what they all are. That's the fun part.

**Discovery System**: 
- We've hidden **160 easter eggs** throughout TabbyMcTabface.
- Each one is context-aware (time, tab count, domains, patterns)
- You'll know when you've found one - the quip will be *different*
- No achievement tracker (we're not *that* organized)
- You just have to... experiment

#### The Only Hint We'll Give You:

**The Answer to Everything** üåå
- **Hint**: Douglas Adams fans will know
- **Clue**: It's a very specific number of tabs
- **Example Quip**: _"42 tabs. The answer to life, the universe, and everything. Or just poor tab management."_

#### Other Easter Eggs Exist For:

- ‚ùì Late night browsing habits
- ‚ùì Extreme tab counts (both high and low)
- ‚ùì Domain-specific patterns
- ‚ùì Time-based triggers
- ‚ùì Organizational achievements
- ‚ùì Philosophical moments
- ‚ùì Obscure pop culture references
- ‚ùì Tab management milestones
- ‚ùì And many more...

**The Challenge**: Can you discover them all? 

**Tips for Easter Egg Hunters**:
1. Pay attention to *when* you use your browser
2. Notice *which* sites you have open
3. Try unusual tab counts (why stop at 10?)
4. Create lots of groups (or none at all)
5. Use the extension at weird hours
6. Look for patterns in the quips you receive
7. The more you use TabbyMcTabface, the more you'll discover

**Pro Tip**: Some easter eggs are easier to trigger accidentally than on purpose. Just browse normally and enjoy the surprises!

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### Tab Management Strategy

1. **Use Groups Liberally**: Don't hesitate to create groups. They're free!
2. **Name Groups Clearly**: Future-you will thank present-you
3. **Regular Cleanup**: Use "Feeling Lucky" to reduce tab bloat
4. **Pin Important Tabs**: Pin tabs you always need (they're protected from Feeling Lucky)

### Making the Most of Easter Eggs

1. **Don't Try Too Hard**: The best discoveries happen naturally
2. **Pay Attention**: Notice when a quip feels *extra* clever
3. **Experiment**: Try weird tab counts, browse at odd hours, open lots of one site
4. **Share Discoveries**: Screenshot and share (but don't spoil everything!)
5. **Stay Curious**: There are 105 hidden easter eggs - you won't find them all in a day
6. **Browse Differently**: Sometimes the most mundane habits trigger the best surprises

**The Golden Rule**: If you're trying to "game" the system to find easter eggs, you're missing the point. Just use your browser naturally and enjoy the surprises when they happen.

### Performance Tips

1. **Group Inactive Tabs**: Reduces memory usage
2. **Close Old Tabs**: Use Feeling Lucky regularly
3. **Monitor Stats**: Keep an eye on tab count
4. **Restart Browser**: If you have 100+ tabs, consider a fresh start
