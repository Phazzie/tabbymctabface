Write a concise 1.1 App Overview, introducing TabbyMcTabface and its core purpose as a Chrome browser extension. Keep it brief and engaging, setting the stage for the rest of the document. Adhere to KISS principles in your overview – clear, simple, and directly stating the app's function. Target length: approximately 3-4 sentences."
	•	PROMPT 2: "Continue generating Section I of the TabbyMcTabface Design Document:  I. INTRODUCTION (continued). Now write 1.2 Target Audience. Define the intended user base for TabbyMcTabface. Be specific – consider demographics, user needs, and motivations. Remember our target user is 'intelligent users, potentially with ADD'. Expand on this profile, considering their likely browsing habits and why TabbyMcTabface would appeal to them. Aim for a user profile description of approximately 4-6 sentences, highlighting user empathy and understanding, in line with user-centric design principles."
	•	PROMPT 3: "Complete Section I of the TabbyMcTabface Design Document: I. INTRODUCTION (continued).Write 1.3 Core Value Proposition. Clearly and concisely state the unique value proposition of TabbyMcTabface for its target audience. What key benefit does it offer that differentiates it from other tab managers? Focus on the combined value of tab management and passive-aggressive humor. Articulate the core problem TabbyMcTabface solves and how it solves it uniquely and engagingly. Keep it concise and impactful, aiming for a value proposition statement of approximately 3-4 sentences. Ensure the value proposition aligns with KISS principles – clear, direct, and user-benefit focused."
SECTION II: CORE FUNCTIONALITY & FEATURES (MVP)
	•	PROMPT 4: "Begin generating Section II of the TabbyMcTabface Design Document: II. CORE FUNCTIONALITY & FEATURES (MVP). Write 2.1 Tab Grouping. Describe the basic, user-initiated tab grouping functionality that will be included in the TabbyMcTabface MVP. Explain how users will create, name, and assign tabs to groups. Emphasize the simplicity of the user interaction and the visual separation in the tab bar. Keep the description focused on essential MVP functionality, adhering to KISS and YAGNI principles – basic, functional grouping, no unnecessary complexities. Aim for a clear and concise functional description of approximately 4-6 sentences."
	•	PROMPT 5: "Continue generating Section II of the TabbyMcTabface Design Document: II. CORE FUNCTIONALITY & FEATURES (MVP) (continued). Write 2.2 'Feeling Lucky?' Button. Describe the functionality of the 'Feeling Lucky?' button in detail. Explain what happens when the user clicks this button – tab selection process (random, excluding pinned/active tabs – confirm exclusions), tab closing action, and any humorous feedback the user receives upon clicking the button (brief mention, detail humor delivery in later sections). Emphasize the button's dual nature – functional tab closing and humorous element. Keep the description clear, concise, and focused on user interaction and functionality, adhering to KISS and YAGNI principles – simple, direct action with a humorous twist. Aim for a clear functional description of approximately 4-6 sentences."
	•	PROMPT 6: "Continue generating Section II of the TabbyMcTabface Design Document: II. CORE FUNCTIONALITY & FEATURES (MVP) (continued). Write 2.3 Humor System (Single Default Level).

Explain the core purpose of the Humor System – to inject passive-aggressive humor into the tab management experience. Briefly mention how humor is delivered (Popup UI Notifications and chrome.notifications – detail delivery in Section V), and what type of humor to expect (passive-aggressive, subtle, contextual – detail humor style principles in Section V). Focus on giving the reader a clear overview of the Humor System as a core feature enhancement to the basic tab manager, adhering to KISS and YAGNI principles – simple humor system for MVP, focus on core functionality first. Aim for a clear overview of approximately 4-6 sentences."
	•	PROMPT 7: "Complete Section II of the TabbyMcTabface Design Document: II. CORE FUNCTIONALITY & FEATURES (MVP) (continued). Write 2.4 Deferred Features (Tab Searching). Explicitly list 'Tab Searching' as a deferred feature for future versions of TabbyMcTabface. Justify why Tab Searching is deferred for V1, explicitly referencing KISS and YAGNI principles – Tab Searching, while valuable, is not essential for the MVP core and adding it now would increase complexity and development time. Clearly state that Tab Searching is planned for potential future implementation but is intentionally excluded from V1 MVP for focus and rapid validation of core tab grouping and humor features. Keep the justification brief and principle-driven, aiming for approximately 2-3 sentences."

Describe how TabbyMcTabface will access, read, and manage the JSON data during runtime. Explain how the extension will load the JSON data (on extension startup, on demand?), where the JSON file will be located within the extension package, and how the IQuipStorageinterface will be used to abstract data access from the rest of the application. Emphasize efficient data loading and access strategies and how the IQuipStorage interface promotes DRY data access logic and Loose Coupling by separating data access implementation from data usage throughout the extension. Keep the description practical and focused on efficient and principle-driven data management."
