```

**Description** (you can use this):

# TabbyMcTabface - Tab Management with Attitude

Tired of boring tab managers? Meet TabbyMcTabface: the extension that judges your browsing habits while actually helping you organize them.

## What It Does

- **Smart Tab Groups**: Group tabs with snarky commentary
- **"I'm Feeling Lucky"**: Close random tabs when you're overwhelmed
- **Passive-Aggressive Quips**: 75 supportive-but-skeptical messages
- **160 Hidden Easter Eggs**: Discover clever surprises as you browse
- **Mystery System**: Only 1 hint - the rest is up to you to find

## Perfect For

- People with 47+ tabs open (we see you)
- Late-night coders who need judgment
- Anyone who wants humor with their productivity
- Easter egg hunters and achievement seekers

## Privacy First

- No data collection
- No tracking
- No analytics
- Everything runs locally in your browser

## Features

✅ Create tab groups with one click
✅ Random tab closure (gambling for your browser)
✅ Context-aware humor (it knows when you're struggling)
✅ 160 easter eggs (good luck finding them all!)
✅ Dark theme with smooth animations
✅ Keyboard shortcuts
✅ Zero configuration needed

## The Personality

TabbyMcTabface has one mode: Supportive Skepticism™

It sounds helpful but doubts your choices. It's like having a sarcastic cat manage your tabs.

Examples:
- "You must know what you're doing with all these tabs."
- "Another Wikipedia tab. This one will definitely get read."
- "Grouping tabs: The digital equivalent of 'I'll organize this later.'"

## Easter Eggs

We're not telling you what the triggers are. That ruins the fun.

**One Hint**: Try having exactly 42 tabs open.

The rest? Pay attention, experiment, browse naturally. There are 159 more hidden mysteries waiting.

## Who Built This?

TabbyMcTabface is a demonstration of Seam-Driven Development (SDD) - a methodology that prioritizes contracts and testability. It's also just a really fun tab manager.

Built with TypeScript, tested with Vitest, documented to death.
